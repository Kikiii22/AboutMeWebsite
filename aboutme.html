                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                <p>Well,I am just a girl that follows her dreams.Born on 21.07.2003 in Tetovo what makes me 19 years old today.At the moment i can say that in less than a month i am turning 20 so my teenage years are sadly over.As you can guess (if you like zodiac) i am a cancer,which makes me a really emotional person.I am raised in a small but lovely family that includes my sister,my father and my mother.Two years i was living peacefully and then my sister was born.Just kidding,she is the best thing that happened in my life and the person who i can trust the most.
                    Since middle school I love science, especially math and biology.In these fields I have
                    participated in competitions and projects and I have won a large number of diplomas and certificates
                    and recognitions at the regional and state level.
                    </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>From september I will be a second year student in college.I am studying computer science in the best college in our country-FINKI.
                    I finished the first year successfully and I expect to continue like that.
                    For the college choice I was really scared if FINKI is the best option for me because i didnt have a lot of background in programming but hard work pays of and I started to love programming.In a few words, I would describe myself as talented,
                    ambitious, intelligent, communicative and cheerful person.</p>

        <h2>More about my education</h2>
        <div class="box">
            <p> I have started middle school in 2009 where nine years passed with some good friends with whom I still keep in touch and
                wonderful teachers who laid the foundation of my education, believed in me and
                they supported my every step. During my primary education, I participated in
                a large number of competitions organized by accredited associations, projects and activities
                held in and outside my school. By my primary school I am
                declared "Student of the Generation", and I have completed primary education with an excellent grade
                success (average 5.00). I have received recognition for my successes by
                the mayor of Tetovo municipality.</p>
            <p>My choice for high school was Yahya Kemal College.I have won a scholarship and i decided that it is the best option for me.Yahya Kemal allowed me to participate in projects and
                activities that are organized by the school and a lot of International competitions.I was member of some clubs like Travel club,Cooking club,Humanity club and Reading club
                which were held after classes where we all expressed our opinions, ideas and
                attitudes.Through all years i had excellent GPA (5.00 average).
